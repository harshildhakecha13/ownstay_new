    title: 'AI Receptionist vs. Human Front Desk: What Hotels Are Actually Choosing',
    excerpt:
      "The debate isn't AI vs. humans — it's about where each excels. We analyzed 500 hotels to find out how the best properties are blending both.",
    author: { name: 'Ellis Zalavadiya', role: 'Co-Founder & CEO', avatar: 'EZ' },
    content: {
      introduction:
        'Over the past two years, hoteliers have faced unprecedented staffing constraints alongside soaring guest expectations for 24/7 instant gratification. Rather than replacing human warm welcomes, high-performing hotels are using conversational AI as an invisible shield that deflects repetitive tasks.',
      keyTakeaways: [
        '84% of front desk inquiries are routine (WiFi codes, breakfast hours, parking permits, late checkout).',
        'Hotels deploying hybrid AI-human front desks report 32% higher staff retention due to eliminated burnout.',
        'Guest satisfaction (CSAT) scores increase when zero-wait responses are guaranteed at 2:00 AM.',

        },
        {
          heading: '2. Zero-Latency Escalation Protocols',
          body: 'The key to successful AI adoption is knowing when NOT to use AI. If a guest expresses distress, billing disputes, or special medical needs, Ownstay detects conversational sentiment and immediately escalates the ticket to the manager on duty with full transcript context.',

      introduction:
        'With international tourism surging globally, hospitality operators are welcoming guests from dozens of linguistic backgrounds daily. Expecting front desk staff to speak fluent Japanese, German, Arabic, and French is impossible — but guests still deserve native-quality support.',

      introduction:
        'Despite the rise of messaging apps, telephone calls remain the most urgent communication channel for hotel guests. When a guest calls at 11:00 PM from an airport shuttle, hold music is an instant dealbreaker.',
